# N-Particle-Simulation

## This is our DSA-II 2nd year project

### In this method we have applied the method of collision detection using the KD-TREE data-structure.

#### Algorithm:
	1] Create the KD-Tree using the array 
	2] Upadte the particle position and handle boundary collision
	3] Rebalance the tree 
	4] Find the nearest neighbor of the element 
	5] Check the collision of their nearest neighbor
